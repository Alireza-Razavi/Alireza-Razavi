## Medium Issues

<a name="M-1"></a> 
### [M-1] Return values of `approve()` not checked
Not all IERC20 implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `approve()`. The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

17:         _token.approve(msg.sender, type(uint256).max);

```

<a name="M-2"></a> 
### [M-2] Return values of `transfer()`/`transferFrom()` not checked
Not all ERC20 implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`. The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually transfer anything.

### [M-3] Centralization Risk for trusted owners
Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

25: contract ERC20MultiDelegate is ERC1155, Ownable {

151:     function setUri(string memory uri) external onlyOwner {

## Low Issues

<a name="L-1"></a> 
### [L-1] `approve()`/`safeApprove()` may revert if the current approval is not zero
Calling `approve()` without first calling `approve(0)` if the current approval is non-zero will revert with some tokens, such as Tether (USDT). While Tether is known to do this, it applies to other tokens as well, which are trying to protect against [this attack vector](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit). `safeApprove()` itself also implements this protection. Always reset the approval to zero before changing it to a new value (`SafeERC20.forceApprove()` does this for you), or use `safeIncreaseAllowance()`/`safeDecreaseAllowance()`

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

17:         _token.approve(msg.sender, type(uint256).max);

```
*Github:* [[17](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L17)]



<a name="L-2"></a> 
### [L-2] Constructor / initialization function lacks parameter validation
Constructors and initialization functions play a critical role in contracts by setting important initial states when the contract is first deployed before the system starts. The parameters passed to the constructor and initialization functions directly affect the behavior of the contract / protocol. If incorrect parameters are provided, the system may fail to run, behave abnormally, be unstable, or lack security. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully check each parameter in the constructor and initialization functions. If an exception is found, the transaction should be rolled back.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

/// @audit `_token` not validated
/// @audit `_delegate` not validated
16:     constructor(ERC20Votes _token, address _delegate) {

/// @audit `_token` not validated
/// @audit `_metadata_uri` not validated
44:     constructor(
            ERC20Votes _token,
            string memory _metadata_uri
        ) ERC1155(_metadata_uri) {

```
*Github:* [[16](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L16), [44](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L44)]



<a name="L-3"></a> 
### [L-3] Missing zero address check in constructor
Constructors often take address parameters to initialize important components of a contract, such as owner or linked contracts. However, without a checking, there's a risk that an address parameter could be mistakenly set to the zero address (0x0). This could be due to an error or oversight during contract deployment. A zero address in a crucial role can cause serious issues, as it cannot perform actions like a normal address, and any funds sent to it will be irretrievable. It's therefore crucial to include a zero address check in constructors to prevent such potential problems. If a zero address is detected, the constructor should revert the transaction.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

/// @audit missing zero check for `_delegate`
16:     constructor(ERC20Votes _token, address _delegate) {

```
*Github:* [[16](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L16)]



<a name="L-4"></a> 
### [L-4] Owner can renounce Ownership
Each of the following contracts implements or inherits the `renounceOwnership()` function. This can represent a certain risk if the ownership is renounced for any other reason than by design. Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

25: contract ERC20MultiDelegate is ERC1155, Ownable {

```
*Github:* [[25](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L25)]



<a name="L-5"></a> 
### [L-5] Prevent re-setting a state variable with the same value
Not only is wasteful in terms of gas, but this is especially problematic when an event is emitted and the old and new values set are the same, as listeners might not expect this kind of scenario.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

48:         token = _token;

```
*Github:* [[48](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L48)]



<a name="L-6"></a> 
### [L-6] Solidity version 0.8.20 or above may not work on other chains due to PUSH0
Solidity version 0.8.20 or above uses the new [Shanghai EVM](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note) which introduces the PUSH0 opcode. This op code may not yet be implemented on all evm-chains or Layer2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. Consider using an earlier solidity version.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

2: pragma solidity ^0.8.2;

```
*Github:* [[2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L2)]



<a name="L-7"></a> 
### [L-7] Unsafe downcast
When a type is downcast to a smaller type, the higher order bits are truncated, effectively applying a modulo to the original value. Without any other checks, this wrapping will lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

195:         return ERC1155(this).balanceOf(msg.sender, uint256(uint160(delegate)));

```
*Github:* [[195](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L195)]



<a name="L-8"></a> 
### [L-8] Use Ownable2Step instead of Ownable
`Ownable2Step` and `Ownable2StepUpgradeable` prevent the contract ownership from mistakenly being transferred to an address that cannot handle it (e.g. due to a typo in the address), by requiring that the recipient of the owner permissions actively accept via a contract call of its own.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

25: contract ERC20MultiDelegate is ERC1155, Ownable {

```
*Github:* [[25](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L25)]




## Non Critical Issues

<a name="NC-1"></a> 
### [NC-1] Assembly blocks should have extensive comments
Assembly blocks take a lot more time to audit than normal Solidity code, and often have gotchas and side-effects that the Solidity versions of the same code do not. Consider adding more comments explaining what is being done in every step of the assembly code, and describe why assembly is being used instead of Solidity.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

180:         assembly {

```
*Github:* [[180](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L180)]



<a name="NC-2"></a> 
### [NC-2] `abi.encodePacked()` should be replaced with `bytes.concat()`
Solidity version 0.8.4 introduces `bytes.concat()`, which can be used to replace `abi.encodePacked()` on bytes/strings. It can make the intended operation clearer, leading to less reviewer confusion.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

202:         bytes memory bytecode = abi.encodePacked(

207:             abi.encodePacked(

```
*Github:* [[202](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L202), [207](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L207)]



<a name="NC-3"></a> 
### [NC-3] `assert()` should be replaced with `require()` or `revert()`
In versions of Solidity prior to 0.8.0, when encountering an assert all the remaining gas will be consumed. Even after solidity 0.8.0, the assert function is still not recommended, as described in the [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require):
> Assert should only be used to test for internal errors, and to check invariants. Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

131:         assert(amount <= balance);

```
*Github:* [[131](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L131)]



<a name="NC-4"></a> 
### [NC-4] Contract declarations should have NatSpec `@author` annotations

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

15: contract ERC20ProxyDelegator {

```
*Github:* [[15](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L15)]



<a name="NC-5"></a> 
### [NC-5] Complex casting
Consider whether the number of casts is really necessary, or whether using a different type would be more appropriate. Alternatively, add comments to explain in detail why the casts are necessary, and any implicit reasons why the cast does not introduce an overflow.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

195:         return ERC1155(this).balanceOf(msg.sender, uint256(uint160(delegate)));

214:         return address(uint160(uint256(hash)));

```
*Github:* [[195](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L195), [214](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L214)]



<a name="NC-6"></a> 
### [NC-6] Consider adding a block/deny-list
Doing so will significantly increase centralization, but will help to prevent hackers from using stolen tokens.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

15: contract ERC20ProxyDelegator {

25: contract ERC20MultiDelegate is ERC1155, Ownable {

<a name="NC-7"></a> 
### [NC-7] Consider adding formal verification proofs
Formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification/property/invariant, using formal methods of mathematics.

Some tools that are currently available to perform these tests on smart contracts are [SMTChecker](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/smtchecker.html) and [Certora Prover](https://www.certora.com/).

<a name="NC-8"></a> 
### [NC-8] Constants should be put on the left side of comparisons
Putting constants on the left side of comparison statements is a best practice known as [Yoda conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions). Although solidity's static typing system prevents accidental assignments within conditionals, adopting this practice can improve code readability and consistency, especially when working across multiple languages.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

185:         if (bytecodeSize == 0) {

```
*Github:* [[185](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L185)]



<a name="NC-9"></a> 
### [NC-9] Contract should expose an `interface`
All `external`/`public` functions should extend an `interface`. This is useful to make sure that the whole API is extracted.

*Note:* It is possible that the interface is out-of-scope and has not been seen by the bot.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity

151:     function setUri(string memory uri) external onlyOwner {

```
*Github:* [[57](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L57), [151](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/1adbe2cce191140657b8bccffab85103953bdccb/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L151)]



<a name="NC-10"></a> 
### [NC-10] Contracts should each be defined in separate files
Keeping each contract in a separate file makes it easier to work with multiple people, makes the code easier to maintain, and is a common practice on most projects. The following files each contains more than one contract/library/interface.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol

/// @audit another contract is defined in this file
15: contract ERC20ProxyDelegator {

/// @audit another contract is defined in this file
25: contract ERC20MultiDelegate is ERC1155, Ownable {

```

<a name="NC-11"></a> 
### [NC-11] Contracts should have full test coverage
While 100% code coverage does not guarantee that there are no bugs, it often will catch easy-to-find bugs, and will ensure that there are fewer regressions when the code invariably has to be modified. Furthermore, in order to get full coverage, code authors will often have to re-organize their code so that it is more modular, so that each component can be tested separately, which reduces interdependencies between modules and layers, and makes for code that is easier to reason about and audit.

### [NC-13] Enable IR-based code generation
The IR-based code generator was introduced with an aim to not only allow code generation to be more transparent and auditable but also to enable more powerful optimization passes that span across functions. You can enable it on the command line using `--via-ir` or with the option `{"viaIR": true}`. This will take longer to compile, but you can just simple test it before deploying and if you got a better benchmark then you can add --via-ir to your deploy command More on: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/ir-breaking-changes.html

### [NC-14] Events are emitted without the sender information
When an action is triggered based on a user's action, not being able to filter based on who triggered the action makes event processing a lot more cumbersome. Including the `msg.sender` the events of these types of action will make events much more useful to end users, especially when `msg.sender` is not `tx.origin`.

### [NC-18] Large or complicated code bases should implement invariant tests
This includes: large code bases, or code with lots of inline-assembly, complicated math, or complicated interactions between multiple contracts. Invariant fuzzers such as Echidna require the test writer to come up with invariants which should not be violated under any circumstances, and the fuzzer tests various inputs and function calls to ensure that the invariants always hold. Even code with 100% code coverage can still have bugs due to the order of the operations a user performs, and invariant fuzzers may help significantly.

### [NC-34] Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## Gas Optimizations

### [GAS-2] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas
If an `internal` function is only used once, there is no need to modularize it, unless the function calling it would otherwise be too long and complex. Not inlining costs 20 to 40 gas because of two extra JUMP instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

### [GAS-4] Operator `>=`/`<=` costs less gas than operator `>`/`<`
The compiler uses opcodes `GT` and `ISZERO` for code that uses `>`, but only requires `LT` for `>=`. A similar behavior applies for `>`, which uses opcodes `LT` and `ISZERO`, but only requires `GT` for `<=`. It can save 3 gas for each. It should be converted to the `<=`/`>=` equivalent when comparing against integer literals.

### [GAS-8] Use assembly to compute hashes to save gas

### [GAS-9] Use assembly to emit events
To efficiently emit events, it's possible to utilize assembly by making use of scratch space and the free memory pointer. This approach has the advantage of potentially avoiding the costs associated with memory expansion.

However, it's important to note that in order to safely optimize this process, it is preferable to cache and restore the free memory pointer.

A good example of such practice can be seen in [Solady's](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC1155.sol#L167) codebase.

### [GAS-13] Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for function arguments that do not get mutated
Mark data types as `calldata` instead of `memory` where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as `calldata`. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies `memory` storage.
