## Medium Issues

<a name="M-1"></a> 
### [M-1] Centralization Risk for trusted owners
Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

*There are <b>10</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

6: import {Ownable, Ownable2Step} from "/home/myubuntu/Desktop/2023-11-canto/1155tech-contracts/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol";

10: contract Market is ERC1155, Ownable2Step {

91:     constructor(string memory _uri, address _paymentToken) ERC1155(_uri) Ownable() {

104:     function changeBondingCurveAllowed(address _bondingCurve, bool _newState) external onlyOwner {

118:     ) external onlyShareCreator returns (uint256 id) {

244:     function claimPlatformFee() external onlyOwner {

300:     function restrictShareCreation(bool _isRestricted) external onlyOwner {

72:     function withdrawCarry(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {

```



## Low Issues

<a name="L-1"></a> 
### [L-1] Missing zero address check in functions with address parameters
Adding a zero address check for each address type parameter can prevent errors.

*There are <b>3</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

/// @audit missing zero check for `_bondingCurve`
104:     function changeBondingCurveAllowed(address _bondingCurve, bool _newState) external onlyOwner {

/// @audit missing zero check for `_bondingCurve`
114:     function createNewShare(
             string memory _shareName,
             address _bondingCurve,
             string memory _metadataURI
         ) external onlyShareCreator returns (uint256 id) {

/// @audit missing zero check for `_address`
309:     function changeShareCreatorWhitelist(address _address, bool _isWhitelisted) external onlyOwner {

```


<a name="L-2"></a> 
### [L-2] `approve()`/`safeApprove()` may revert if the current approval is not zero
Calling `approve()` without first calling `approve(0)` if the current approval is non-zero will revert with some tokens, such as Tether (USDT). While Tether is known to do this, it applies to other tokens as well, which are trying to protect against [this attack vector](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit). `safeApprove()` itself also implements this protection. Always reset the approval to zero before changing it to a new value (`SafeERC20.forceApprove()` does this for you), or use `safeIncreaseAllowance()`/`safeDecreaseAllowance()`

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

51:         SafeERC20.safeApprove(note, cNote, _amount);

```


<a name="L-3"></a> 
### [L-3] Check division by zero is prevented

*There are <b>8</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

197:         fee = (priceForOne * _amount * NFT_FEE_BPS) / 10_000;

285:         uint256 shareHolderFee = (_fee * HOLDER_CUT_BPS) / 10_000;

286:         uint256 shareCreatorFee = (_fee * CREATOR_CUT_BPS) / 10_000;

290:             shareData[_id].shareHolderRewardsPerTokenScaled += (shareHolderFee * 1e18) / _tokenCount;

```

```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/bonding_curve/LinearBondingCurve.sol

23:             fee += (getFee(i) * tokenPrice) / 1e18;

35:         return 1e17 / divisor;

```

```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

75:         uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /

```

### [L-4] Constructor / initialization function lacks parameter validation
Constructors and initialization functions play a critical role in contracts by setting important initial states when the contract is first deployed before the system starts. The parameters passed to the constructor and initialization functions directly affect the behavior of the contract / protocol. If incorrect parameters are provided, the system may fail to run, behave abnormally, be unstable, or lack security. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully check each parameter in the constructor and initialization functions. If an exception is found, the transaction should be rolled back.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/bonding_curve/LinearBondingCurve.sol

/// @audit `_priceIncrease` not validated
10:     constructor(uint256 _priceIncrease) {

```

```solidity

/// @audit `_name` not validated
/// @audit `_symbol` not validated
/// @audit `_cNote` not validated
28:     constructor(

```


<a name="L-5"></a> 
### [L-5] Loss of precision in divisions
Division by large numbers may result in the result being zero, due to solidity not supporting fractions. Consider requiring a minimum amount for the numerator to ensure that it is always larger than the denominator.

*There are <b>8</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

197:         fee = (priceForOne * _amount * NFT_FEE_BPS) / 10_000;

275:             ((shareData[_id].shareHolderRewardsPerTokenScaled - lastClaimedValue) * tokensByAddress[_id][msg.sender]) /

285:         uint256 shareHolderFee = (_fee * HOLDER_CUT_BPS) / 10_000;

286:         uint256 shareCreatorFee = (_fee * CREATOR_CUT_BPS) / 10_000;

290:             shareData[_id].shareHolderRewardsPerTokenScaled += (shareHolderFee * 1e18) / _tokenCount;

```

```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/bonding_curve/LinearBondingCurve.sol

23:             fee += (getFee(i) * tokenPrice) / 1e18;

35:         return 1e17 / divisor;

```

```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

75:         uint256 maximumWithdrawable = (CTokenInterface(cNote).balanceOf(address(this)) * exchangeRate) /

```


<a name="L-6"></a> 
### [L-6] Missing checks for state variable assignments
There are some missing checks in these functions, and this could lead to unexpected scenarios. Consider always adding a sanity check for state variables.

*There are <b>5</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

/// @audit `_newState`
106:         whitelistedBondingCurves[_bondingCurve] = _newState;

/// @audit `_isRestricted`
302:         shareCreationRestricted = _isRestricted;

/// @audit `_isWhitelisted`
311:         whitelistedShareCreators[_address] = _isWhitelisted;

```

```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/bonding_curve/LinearBondingCurve.sol

/// @audit `_priceIncrease`
11:         priceIncrease = _priceIncrease;

```

```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

/// @audit `_cNote`
36:         cNote = _cNote;

```


<a name="L-7"></a> 
### [L-7] Missing zero address check in constructor
Constructors often take address parameters to initialize important components of a contract, such as owner or linked contracts. However, without a checking, there's a risk that an address parameter could be mistakenly set to the zero address (0x0). This could be due to an error or oversight during contract deployment. A zero address in a crucial role can cause serious issues, as it cannot perform actions like a normal address, and any funds sent to it will be irretrievable. It's therefore crucial to include a zero address check in constructors to prevent such potential problems. If a zero address is detected, the constructor should revert the transaction.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

/// @audit missing zero check for `_cNote`
28:     constructor(
            string memory _name,
            string memory _symbol,
            address _owner,
            address _cNote,
            address _csrRecipient
        ) ERC20(_name, _symbol) {

```


<a name="L-8"></a> 
### [L-8] Consider some checks for `address(0)` when setting address state variables
Check for zero-address to avoid the risk of setting `address(0)` for state variables after an update.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

/// @audit `_cNote`
36:         cNote = _cNote;

```


<a name="L-9"></a> 
### [L-9] Use of `tx.origin` is unsafe in almost every context
According to [Vitalik Buterin](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/196/how-do-i-make-my-dapp-serenity-proof), contracts should not `assume that tx.origin will continue to be usable or meaningful`. An example of this is [EIP-3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074#allowing-txorigin-as-signer-1) which explicitly mentions the intention to change its semantics when it's used with new op codes. There have also been calls to [remove](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/683) `tx.origin`, and there are security issues associated with using it for authorization. For these reasons, it's best to completely avoid the feature.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

96:             turnstile.register(tx.origin);

```


<a name="L-10"></a> 
### [L-10] `safeApprove()` is deprecated
[Deprecated](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/bfff03c0d2a59bcd8e2ead1da9aed9edf0080d05/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L38-L45) in favor of `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()`. If only setting the initial allowance to the value that means infinite, `safeIncreaseAllowance()` can be used instead. The function may currently work, but if a bug is found in this version of OpenZeppelin, and the version that you're forced to upgrade to no longer has this function, you'll encounter unnecessary delays in porting and testing replacement contracts.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

51:         SafeERC20.safeApprove(note, cNote, _amount);

```


<a name="L-11"></a> 
### [L-11] Unspecific compiler version pragma

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

2: pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

```



## Non Critical Issues

<a name="NC-1"></a> 
### [NC-1] Addresses shouldn't be hard-coded
It is often better to declare addresses as `constant` or `immutable` which can be assigned in constructor. This allows the code to remain the same across deployments on different networks, and avoids recompilation when addresses need to change.

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

95:             Turnstile turnstile = Turnstile(0xEcf044C5B4b867CFda001101c617eCd347095B44);

```

```solidity

<a name="NC-2"></a> 
### [NC-2] Avoid the use of sensitive terms
Use [alternative variants](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mysql-drops-master-slave-and-blacklist-whitelist-terminology/), e.g. allowlist/denylist instead of whitelist/blacklist

### [NC-3] Multiple `address`/ID mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address`/ID to a `struct`, for readability
Well-organized data structures make code reviews easier, which may lead to fewer bugs. Consider combining related mappings into mappings to structs, so it's clear what data is related

*There are <b>2</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

52:     mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) public tokensByAddress;

55:     mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) public rewardsLastClaimedValue;

```

### [NC-6] Consider adding formal verification proofs
Formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification/property/invariant, using formal methods of mathematics.

Some tools that are currently available to perform these tests on smart contracts are [SMTChecker](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/smtchecker.html) and [Certora Prover](https://www.certora.com/).

### [NC-7] Constants should be put on the left side of comparisons
Putting constants on the left side of comparison statements is a best practice known as [Yoda conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions). Although solidity's static typing system prevents accidental assignments within conditionals, adopting this practice can improve code readability and consistency, especially when working across multiple languages.

### [NC-8] Contract does not follow the Solidity Style Guide's suggested layout ordering
The [style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/style-guide.html#order-of-layout) says that, within a contract, the ordering should be `1) Type declarations`, `2) State variables`, `3) Events`, `4) Modifiers`, and `5) Functions`, but the contract(s) below do not follow this ordering

### [NC-11] Contracts should have full test coverage
While 100% code coverage does not guarantee that there are no bugs, it often will catch easy-to-find bugs, and will ensure that there are fewer regressions when the code invariably has to be modified. Furthermore, in order to get full coverage, code authors will often have to re-organize their code so that it is more modular, so that each component can be tested separately, which reduces interdependencies between modules and layers, and makes for code that is easier to reason about and audit.

### [NC-17] Enable IR-based code generation
The IR-based code generator was introduced with an aim to not only allow code generation to be more transparent and auditable but also to enable more powerful optimization passes that span across functions. You can enable it on the command line using `--via-ir` or with the option `{"viaIR": true}`. This will take longer to compile, but you can just simple test it before deploying and if you got a better benchmark then you can add --via-ir to your deploy command More on: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/ir-breaking-changes.html

### [NC-18] Events are emitted without the sender information
When an action is triggered based on a user's action, not being able to filter based on who triggered the action makes event processing a lot more cumbersome.

### [NC-23] Large or complicated code bases should implement invariant tests
This includes: large code bases, or code with lots of inline-assembly, complicated math, or complicated interactions between multiple contracts. Invariant fuzzers such as Echidna require the test writer to come up with invariants which should not be violated under any circumstances, and the fuzzer tests various inputs and function calls to ensure that the invariants always hold. Even code with 100% code coverage can still have bugs due to the order of the operations a user performs, and invariant fuzzers may help significantly.

### [NC-25] Magic numbers should be replaced with constants
Magic numbers are hard-coded values in code that can make it difficult for developers and maintainers to understand the code, and can also cause confusion or errors. To improve the readability and maintainability of code, it is recommended to replace magic numbers with constants that have good readability.

### [NC-35] NatSpec documentation for function is missing
It is recommended that Solidity contracts are fully annotated using NatSpec for all public interfaces (everything in the ABI). It is clearly stated in the Solidity official documentation. In complex projects such as DeFi, the interpretation of all functions and their arguments and returns is important for code readability and auditability.

*There are <b>4</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity

### [NC-49] Unused import
The identifier is imported but never used within the file.

*There is one instance of this issue:*

/// @audit `IasDFactory`
5: import {IasDFactory} from "../interface/IasDFactory.sol";

```


<a name="NC-50"></a> 
### [NC-50] Unused contract variables
The following state variables are defined but not used. It is recommended to check the code for logical omissions that cause them not to be used. If it's determined that they are not needed anywhere, it's best to remove them from the codebase to improve code clarity and minimize confusion.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

16:     uint256 public constant CREATOR_CUT_BPS = 3_300; // 33%

```


<a name="NC-51"></a> 
### [NC-51] Consider using `delete` rather than assigning zero/false to clear values
The `delete` keyword more closely matches the semantics of what is being done, and draws more attention to the changing of state, which may lead to a more thorough audit of its associated logic.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

256:         shareData[_id].shareCreatorPool = 0;

```


<a name="NC-52"></a> 
### [NC-52] Solidity compiler version is not fixed
To prevent the actual contracts deployed from behaving differently depending on the compiler version, it is recommended to use a fixed solidity version.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

2: pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

```


<a name="NC-53"></a> 
### [NC-53] Expressions for constant values should use `immutable` rather than `constant`
While it doesn't save any gas because the compiler knows that developers often make this mistake, it's still best to use the right tool for the task at hand. There is a difference between `constant` variables and `immutable` variables, and they should each be used in their appropriate contexts. `constants` should be used for literal values written into the code, and `immutable` variables should be used for expressions, or values calculated in, or passed into the constructor.

*There are <b>3</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

14:     uint256 public constant NFT_FEE_BPS = 1_000; // 10%

15:     uint256 public constant HOLDER_CUT_BPS = 3_300; // 33%

16:     uint256 public constant CREATOR_CUT_BPS = 3_300; // 33%

```


<a name="NC-54"></a> 
### [NC-54] Use `@inheritdoc` for overridden functions

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/bonding_curve/LinearBondingCurve.sol

27:     function getFee(uint256 shareCount) public pure override returns (uint256) {

```


<a name="NC-55"></a> 
### [NC-55] Use the latest solidity version for deployment (`0.8.23`)
Upgrading to a newer Solidity release can optimize gas usage, take advantage of new features and improve overall contract efficiency. Where possible, based on compatibility requirements, it is recommended to use newer/latest solidity version to take advantage of the latest optimizations and features.

*There are <b>3</b> instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

2: pragma solidity 0.8.19;

```solidity
File: asD/src/asD.sol

2: pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

```


<a name="NC-56"></a> 
### [NC-56] Use of `override` is unnecessary
Starting with Solidity version [0.8.8](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/contracts.html#function-overriding), using the `override` keyword when the function solely overrides an interface function, and the function doesn't exist in multiple base contracts, is unnecessary.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/bonding_curve/LinearBondingCurve.sol

27:     function getFee(uint256 shareCount) public pure override returns (uint256) {

<a name="NC-58"></a> 
### [NC-58] Names of `private`/`internal` functions should be prefixed with an underscore
It is recommended by the [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/style-guide.html#underscore-prefix-for-non-external-functions-and-variables)

### [NC-59] Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## Gas Optimizations

<a name="GAS-1"></a> 
### [GAS-1] Optimize Gas by Using Do-While Loops
Using `do-while` loops instead of `for` loops can be more gas-efficient. Even if you add an `if` condition to account for the case where the loop doesn't execute at all, a `do-while` loop can still be cheaper in terms of gas.

*There is one instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/bonding_curve/LinearBondingCurve.sol

20:         for (uint256 i = shareCount; i < shareCount + amount; i++) {

```


<a name="GAS-2"></a> 
### [GAS-2] Multiple `address`/ID mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address`/ID to a `struct`, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to [recalculate the key's keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

```


<a name="GAS-3"></a> 
### [GAS-3] Consider activating via-ir for deploying
By using `--via-ir` or `{"viaIR": true}`, the compiler is able to use more advanced [multi-function optimizations](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/ir-breaking-changes.html#solidity-ir-based-codegen-changes), for extra gas savings.

### [GAS-4] Divisions can be `unchecked` to save gas
The expression `type(int).min/(-1)` is the only case where division causes an overflow. Therefore, uncheck can be used to [save gas](https://gist.github.com/DadeKuma/3bc597338ae774b8b3bd43280d55271f) in scenarios where it is certain that such an overflow will not occur.

### [GAS-9] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas
If an `internal` function is only used once, there is no need to modularize it, unless the function calling it would otherwise be too long and complex. Not inlining costs 20 to 40 gas because of two extra JUMP instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata

### [GAS-12] Operator `>=`/`<=` costs less gas than operator `>`/`<`
The compiler uses opcodes `GT` and `ISZERO` for code that uses `>`, but only requires `LT` for `>=`. A similar behavior applies for `>`, which uses opcodes `LT` and `ISZERO`, but only requires `GT` for `<=`. It can save 3 gas for each. It should be converted to the `<=`/`>=` equivalent when comparing against integer literals.

### [GAS-13] Optimize names to save gas

Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save 128 gas each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save 22 gas per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

### [GAS-15] Remove or replace unused state variables
Saves a storage slot. If the variable is assigned a non-zero value, saves Gsset (20000 gas). If it's assigned a zero value, saves Gsreset (2900 gas). If the variable remains unassigned, there is no gas savings unless the variable is `public`, in which case the compiler-generated non-payable getter deployment cost is saved. If the state variable is overriding an interface's public function, mark the variable as `constant` or `immutable` so that it does not use a storage slot.

*There is one instance of this issue:*

### [GAS-17] Optimize External Calls with Assembly for Memory Efficiency
Using interfaces to make external contract calls in Solidity is convenient but can be inefficient in terms of memory utilization. Each such call involves creating a new memory location to store the data being passed, thus incurring memory expansion costs.

Inline assembly allows for optimized memory usage by re-using already allocated memory spaces or using the scratch space for smaller datasets. This can result in notable gas savings, especially for contracts that make frequent external calls.

Additionally, using inline assembly enables important safety checks like verifying if the target address has code deployed to it using `extcodesize(addr)` before making the call, mitigating risks associated with contract interactions.

### [GAS-18] Use assembly to emit events
To efficiently emit events, it's possible to utilize assembly by making use of scratch space and the free memory pointer. This approach has the advantage of potentially avoiding the costs associated with memory expansion.

However, it's important to note that in order to safely optimize this process, it is preferable to cache and restore the free memory pointer.

A good example of such practice can be seen in [Solady's](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC1155.sol#L167) codebase.

### [GAS-22] Use `uint256(1)`/`uint256(2)` instead of `true`/`false` to save gas for changes
Avoids a Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from false to true, after having been true in the past. Since most of the bools aren't changed twice in one transaction, I've counted the amount of gas as half of the full amount, for each variable.

<a name="GAS-23"></a> 
### [GAS-23] Using bitmap to store bool states can save gas
Using a bitmap instead of a bool array or a bool mapping to store boolean states can save gas fees. This is because the bitmap can store 256 boolean values in a single slot instead of 256 slots, which can save gas when writing bool values or when reading multiple bool values from the same slot.

### [GAS-24] Using bools for storage incurs overhead

### [GAS-25] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

### [GAS-26] Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for function arguments that do not get mutated
Mark data types as `calldata` instead of `memory` where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically loaded into memory. If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as `calldata`. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies `memory` storage.

### [GAS-27] Use Custom Errors
[Source](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/)
Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost.

### [GAS-28] Constructors can be marked as `payable` to save deployment gas
Payable functions cost less gas to execute, because the compiler does not have to add extra checks to ensure that no payment is provided. A constructor can be safely marked as payable, because only the deployer would be able to pass funds, and the project itself would not pass any funds.

```solidity
File: 1155tech-contracts/src/Market.sol

91:     constructor(string memory _uri, address _paymentToken) ERC1155(_uri) Ownable() {

```

### [GAS-29] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided.

### [GAS-31] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

### [GAS-32] Use `!= 0` instead of `> 0` for unsigned integer comparison

### [GAS-33] Using assembly to check for zero can save gas
